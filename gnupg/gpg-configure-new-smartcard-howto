# HOWTO for setting up a new smartcard (yubi5) on linux (fedora/debian/centos tested)
# This howto is focused on a transfer of a backup of a private key 
# with subkeys for signing/encrypting/authenticating to a new smartcard.

# it is advised to NOT create the keys on the smartcard itself IF you ever want
# to reuse them on another smartcard.
# a strategy might be to create new keys (with a passphrase for key usage) and
# then symmetrically encrypt these keys with a different passphrase for key storage.
# create backups (3-2-1 backup strategy at a minimum please) of these encrypted keys.
# you can then safely use the generated keys to transfer them to a smartcard and
# have a backup to retry if you mess it up.
# it is assumed that you have uploaded your public key to a keyserver.


######################### start here - setup
# check smarcard readers (install packages if needed)
pcsc_scan -n 
# insert the new smartcard to see what info is there

# check card characteristics via dmesg
dmesg 

# use a new gnupg homedir with seperate keyring etc.
mkdir ~/gnupg-test
chmod 700 ~/gnupg-test
cd ~/gnupg-test

#TRICKY: this relies heavily on the env variable GNUPGHOME
# which we manually set, so watch out that you do not accidentally start working in 
# a new shell halfway through this operation
export GNUPGHOME=~/gnupg-test

# check if the environment variable has been picked up succesfully
gpg --version

cp <your-stored-backup-of-gpg-private-key> ~/gnupg-test/
# decrypt the key you have symmetrically encrypted somewhere WITH A SAFELY STORED PASSPHRASE.
gpg --decrypt ~/gnupg-test/<backup-of-gpg-private-key> > mykey.key
# import the private key. it SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE passphrase protected so
# use A SAFELY STORED DIFFERENT PASSPHRASE FROM THE ONE ABOVE 
gpg --import mykey.key

# check status in new keyring
gpg -k
gpg -K
# get your public key with the latest data/signatures/validity information etc
gpg --fetch-key <url>
# import from 
# https://sks-keyservers.net/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x5E586F16BF002399
# or https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x5E586F16BF002399
# in case this does not work, download the public key and 
# store it in a file public-key.pub 
gpg --import public-key.pub
# check
gpg -k



# now edit the new card
gpg --edit-card
> help
# change to admin mode and set normal/admin pin via the menu changes
> admin
> help
# default pin yubi: 123456. default admin pin yubi 12345678
# also change the PUK/reset code
# default PUK yubi: 12345678
# STORE THESE NEW UNIQUE PINS/PUK/RESET codes somewhere safely.
# in case you brick it: https://developers.yubico.com/ykneo-openpgp/ResetApplet.html
# also change other details relevant with the url of the public key being the most relevant
# url of public key: https://sks-keyservers.net/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x5E586F16BF002399 


# transfer the keys: THIS DESTROYS THEM ON DISK. make sure there is a backup!
# in case you do not have a key, follow this guide and make a backup before transferring keys to cards
# see https://www.sidorenko.io/post/2014/11/yubikey-or-openpgp-smartcards-for-newbies/

# start editing the key on disk for transfer to the smartcard.
# the keys on disk will be destroyed after this and will only live on the smartcard.
# keystubs (binary files pointing to the location of the keys on the smartcard) will 
# be created in GNUPGHOME/private-keys-v1.d/
# stubkeys can always be (re)created with gpg --card-status
gpg --edit-key <key-id>
> toggle
> key 1
> keytocard # and select (encrypt/sign/authenticate)
> key 1
> key 2
> keytocard # and select

# now save the configuration

# fetch public key
gpg --fetch-keys https://sks-keyservers.net/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x5E586F16BF002399

# create a keystub for the keys
gpg --card-status


# your card will have a serial printed on the card. this can be used to id the card that is asked for by gpg
# using multiple cards with gpg is not possible currently (there is a pull request in the works)

# https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/154702/gpg-encryption-subkey-on-multiple-smart-cards-issue
# remove any stubs you might have of a previous smartcard from the default gnupg home directory
# and recreate them (alternatively, setup udev rules to detect the smartcard and use the correct keystubs)
# you can find out the stubkey-id with the command 'gpg --with-keygrip -K'

rm ~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d/<stubkey-id>.key
# get rid of the environment variable
unset GNUPGHOME
# re-create stubs
gpg --card-status


# finally, remove all traces from disk with shred -uz
